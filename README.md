This is Tony's complete CMA ("Click More Authoring") project, 
for writing initial PT notes that paste nicely into his organization's
EPIC Care Ambulatory EMR (electronic medical record), known as PRISM.
It is based on an IE9 build of the microsoft HTA (hypertext application) platform.

It is a work in progress. The database backend is scarcely developed,
and is likely to remain that way.

Once this project is downloaded and unzipped to a spot on the S: drive (UVMMC),
future updates can be downloaded and install from the "lite" repo,
and unzipped to the "lite" subdirectory of the local project.

The only exception would be in the event that something is changed or added
in files outside of "lite", like a jquery ui library add-in.
This situation will be exceedingly rare.
